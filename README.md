# React Table Gradient Example

> I want to build a barebones react example, from scratch and with as little boiler plate and setup as possible, to demo some react/html/css magic. Specifically I want to show off how you can have a table wider than the screen that shows a gradient along the right edge to indicate you need to keep scrolling right because there are more columns to view but then as you reach the end of the table the gradient drifts off and disappears because no more scrolling is needed.
